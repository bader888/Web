[1] - Why Do We Need Logging in Web Applications?
 -Event Recording: Logging captures various events within an application, 
such as user actions,
system errors, data transactions, etc. 
These logged events are usually stored in files, databases,
or external logging services, providing a historical record of what has happened over time.
 -Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logs are an invaluable resource for developers when debugging or troubleshooting issues.
By examining log files, developers can trace the sequence of events leading up to an error or performance bottleneck,
making it easier to identify and fix problems.

[2] - Components of Logging
Log Levels:
Log Messages:
Log Output:
Log Frameworks:

[3] - What is Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API?

[4] - What are the Logging Providers in ASP.NET Core Web API?
Console Logging Provider: 
Debug Logging Provider: 
Serilog Logging Provider:

[5] - How Do We Configure Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API?
Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API can be configured in the appsettings.json file or programmatically in the Program.cs file.
ASP.NET Core includes a default logging configuration that is set up when your application starts. This configuration logs to the console and Debug window by default.

[6] - Add Logging Providers:
builder.Services.AddLogging(builder =>
{
    builder.AddConsole();
    // Add other providers as needed
});

[7] - Create and Use ILogger Instances:
public class MyService
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void MyMethod()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("This is a log message.");
    }
}

[8] - Best Practices:
To minimize the impact of logging on performance, follow best practices such as: 
-Log only what is necessary.
-Use asynchronous logging where possible.
-Avoid complex object serialization.
-Use appropriate logging levels to reduce the volume of logged information.
-Consider the impact of logging destinations and choose them based on the applicationâ€™s requirements and environment.
