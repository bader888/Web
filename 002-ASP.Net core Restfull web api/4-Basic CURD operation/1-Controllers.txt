[1] - Controllers
 in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications play an important role in handling HTTP requests and responses. 
They are responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests, handling user input, 
retrieving and saving data, and determining the response to send back to the client.
 The Controller class in ASP.NET Core Web API must have a “Controller” suffix. 
For example, if you want to add a controller with the name Home, then the name of the controller should be HomeController. 
similarly, if you want to add a controller for Student,
 then the name should be StudentController.

[3] - Best Practices
 Thin Controllers: Keep business logic out of controllers and in services or other layers.
 Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): Avoid exposing your database models directly; map them to DTOs.
 Consistent Naming Convention: Follow RESTful naming conventions for actions.
 Secure Your API: Implement authentication, authorization, and validate inputs to secure your API.
 Unit Testing: Write unit tests for your controllers to ensure reliability and maintainability.

[4] - ApiController Attribute in ASP.NET Core Web API
The ApiController attribute in ASP.NET Core Web API is a feature introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.1 to enhance the development of HTTP-based APIs. It is applied at the class level and offers several conveniences and conventions that make building clean and well-documented Web APIs easier. Here are some key aspects of the ApiController attribute:

Attribute Routing Requirement: With ApiController, attribute routing becomes a requirement. This means you must use [Route], [HttpGet], [HttpPost], etc., to define the routes for your actions.
Automatic HTTP 400 Responses: It automatically handles model validation errors by providing a standardized response. If the request model does not satisfy the model validation rules, the API responds with a 400 Bad Request without writing additional code.
Binding Source Parameter: The attribute infers the source of parameters for actions. For instance, it assumes [FromBody] for complex type parameters and [FromQuery] for simple types in GET requests. This reduces the need to specify the source of the parameter explicitly.
Enhanced Swagger Support: When used in conjunction with tools like Swashbuckle, it provides better metadata for API documentation. This results in more descriptive Swagger UIs.
